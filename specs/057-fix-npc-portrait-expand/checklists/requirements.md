- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows

## Notes

- Observed pre-specify: expanded NPC portrait in side menu uses fixed height (~110) with cover-style slot — box does not follow image aspect; fix must cap size so layout/screen stay usable.
- Clarify session 2026-08-05 complete (Q1–Q2 locked): shrink-to-fit; max height ~50% viewport. Ready for `/speckit-plan`.
